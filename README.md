# Front-End Starter Kit

---

This front-end starter kit is designed to get you going, fast, whenever you're coding in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
It provides a basic folder structure along with a fully configured `webpack.config.js`.

The `webpack.config.js` includes several plugins and loaders that help optimize and minify your **CSS** and **JS**, provide various `link` tags for favicons, post-process your **CSS** to provide all sorts of vendor and web browser prefixes, and much more.

The `package.json` file includes **ESLint** and **Prettier** configuration settings and provides a couple of scripts to help you develop code.
Remember to run `npm install` beforehand to install all the development dependencies that are needed for this starter kit to work.

---

`npm run dev`

Opens up **webpack-dev-server**

---

`npm run build`

Builds code for production.

**Make sure to set the mode from `development` to `production` in the `webpack.config.js`**

Remember, this is just a starter kit, so if you want to jazz it up a bit more than what is provided, by all means, go right ahead!

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž
